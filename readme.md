## This repo shows off the new code oneboxing in issues


See issue [#1](https://github.com/YesThatAllen/onebox-code-in-readme/issues/1)  
https://github.com/YesThatAllen/onebox-code-in-readme/issues/1  

It's got a link where code is not oneboxed, and one which is. The difference is if the link is pointing to a commit.  

The question is, how can readme.md files get the same love?  

If so, this would not be oneboxed:  

https://github.com/YesThatAllen/onebox-code-in-readme/blob/master/sample.json#L2-L10


but this would, even in a readme.md.
